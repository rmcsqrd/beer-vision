Ever been curious where the bubbles in your beer come from? How they just seem to appear from nowhere? Why there's just so much dang foam?  

 These are all great questions that I'm not going to answer within this repo. Instead, I'm using computer vision to try to quantify the emission rate of beer bubbles as a Poisson birth/death process.
