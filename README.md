## Beervision.jl
Ever been curious where the bubbles in your beer come from? How they just seem to appear from nowhere? Why there's just so much dang foam?  

 These are all great questions that I'm not going to answer within this repo. Instead, I'm using computer vision to try to quantify the emission rate of beer bubbles as an exponentially distributed random variable.

### Usage
(Note this project is a work in progress so I haven't fully buttoned up the usage section)
- Install Julia (https://julialang.org/downloads/)
- Clone this repository to `/some/location/on/your/computer`
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/rmcsqrd/beer-vision.git
```
- Open the Julia REPL (this assumes you set up your path correctly) and include the file
```
    $ julia
    julia > include("/some/location/on/your/computer/beervision.jl")
```
- After doing this the project should precompile and do some stuff. I have not tested this at all.
